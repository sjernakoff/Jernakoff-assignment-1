		<h2> About </h2>
		<p> Mullen Library is the university library at Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. It serves the student and faculty populations of CUA as well as other members of the Washington Research Library Consortium. Their <a href="https://libraries.catholic.edu/about-us/mission.html">mission</a> is to "support and enrich the instructional, research, and service programs of the University."
		<br>
		<h2>Resources</h2>
		<p>Mullen Library provides a number of resources and services to its users. The physical library, located on the CUA campus, has multiple floors of study and work spaces, an open stacks, and computer labs for online work, printing, and scanning. Circulation and information desks are staffed by students and staff to aid in locating, checking out, and returning books. There is an exhibit hall on the first floor where visitors can view rotating exhibits, often featuring items from the library's collections. Mullen Library is also home to a tutoring center where students can receive tutoring in subjects like math and writing outside of their classes.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Online Resources</h2>
		<p>Mullen Library also has a robust <a href="https://libraries.catholic.edu/">website</a> which users can access from any Internet connected device. Here are some of the resources users can access via the website:

			<tr>
				<td><a href="https://wrlc-cu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01WRLC_CAA%3A01WRLC_CAA&lang=en">SearchBox</a></td>
				<td>SearchBox allows users to search for various resources in Mullen Library's collection. The search function uses keywords and Boolean operators to match the search queries with items in Mullen Library's physical collection, the collections of WRLC members, and online resources such as those held in databases of which Mullen Library is a subscriber. Advanced search tools and filters allow users to refine their searches by author and contributors, by date, by type of resource, by location, and more.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><a href="https://guides.lib.cua.edu/">LibGuides</a></td>
				<td>Libguides are lists of resources useful for many different subjects, curated by Mullen Library's staff and liaison librarians. These guides range from tutorials on introduction to conducting research in general, to how to use Mullen Library's website tools effectively, to detailed lists of resources and databases for each subject of study at the University.</td>

Users can log in using their CUA credentials and request articles, chapters, or entire texts. Those materials are then borrowed or purchased from outside sources when possible and delivered to the user, physically or digitally. It is a great tool for expanding the availability of research materials even beyond those held by Mullen itself.</td>

	<h2>My Thoughts</h2>
		<p>I have used Mullen library and many of its services extensively during my undergraduate and graduate careers as a student at CUA. Some of my favorite features include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Access to streaming databases.</b> These include the Met Opera On Demand, Medici.tv, Naxos music library, and Berlin Philharmoniker Digital Concerthall. As a music student, it is important to have access to high quality performance recordings for studying, plus it is a great resource to have available for entertainment purposes. For example, I used my library credentials to access Met Opera On Demand to listen to the opera La Boheme while coding this website, since we are rehearsing this opera for the University Music and Drama departments' production next month.</li>
			<li><b>WRLC and ILL requests.</b> I have used ILL multiple times, both to access digital resources and physical books, and I use WRLC usually multiple times a semester. This has been an invaluable resource for my research activities, especially in my musicology coursework as a dual degree student.</li>
			<li><b>Physical space.</b> When I need a quiet, comfortable space on campus to focus on work, Mullen Library has multiple areas I can use. I also especially like the open stacks and the ability to search for physical materials housed on site by myself without having to rely on a mebmer of circulation staff to find items for me.</li>
			<li><b>Reference collection.</b> Some items are available in the library for users to access, but are non-circulating. It is useful to always have these items available and in a fixed location for easy and quick reference whenever needed. In addition, there is a scanner nearby the reference section, so it is easy to make a scan from a non-circulating volume to print or view digitally outside of the library.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I think Mullen Library's physical space and online system are very accommodating and easy to use once a user gets used to how they work. However, I believe the university and the library can do more to introduce and teach users, especially students, how to best use the library and its resources, both for research and academically oriented uses and for personal uses. Many of the library's resources I only learned about in my first year of graduate school, when I took a musicology class called "Research Methodology" which included multiple class lectures on library resources and a detailed quiz on how to use its search functions efficiently. I learned many tricks in this class that I had not encountered at all in my four years of undergrad. I think faculty and library staff can both do more to introduce students to the many resources offered by the library, and to encourage students to utilize the library for more than simply picking up required course materials, printing, and visiting the tutoring center.</p>
